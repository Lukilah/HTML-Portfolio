<h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All - Time</h2>

<hr /> 

<h3>Scarface</h3>
<p>Loved the rags to riches story. And how we can still have morals in a dark & morally corrupt world.</p>

<h3>La La Land</h3>
<p>Loved the story of how sometimes love isn't meant to be and in the end & making peace with that and moving on.</p>

<h3>Dune</h3>
<p>Loved how the story portrayed betrayal, deception, power.</p>
